				<h1>A byte about me.</h1>
				<p>Recent Full Sail University graduate, Bachelor’s of Science in Software Development. Passionate about creating elegant software solutions to problems in the modern world and solutions that make people’s lives easier. Interested include software engineering, cryptology: the study and analysis of secret codes, mathematics, and finding new ways to solve problems among other things. Graduated from Highschool with high honors. Awarded the Metro-Suburban All Academic Conference Award for my efforts on the field and in the classroom. Began university with the intent of perusing Chemistry before realizing my true passion for computers and software. Full Sail University is helping me to achieve my passion and realize my potential in this industry where I strive to create elegant solutions that make things easier not harder. I studied algorithms and data structures and implemented search algorithms such as the Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and variations of the TSP (traveling salesman problem) among others. Recently I developed my own adaption to Conway’s Game of Life. Such simple rules and theory yet profound and reaching implications. As I continue to develop my skills and knowledge in this industry I hope to make a positive impact for those around me.</p>
